There's no code-based solution to fix this bug, as the problem appears to stem from an issue within Expo Go for Android.  The focus should be on these steps:

1. **Report the bug:** Report the issue to the Expo community or on the Expo GitHub repository to ensure developers know about the issue and its intermittent nature. Include details about your Android device, OS version, and any other relevant information.
2. **Check for updates:** Keep Expo Go and the Android OS up to date, as new releases might fix the issue.
3. **Monitor Expo's releases:**  Watch for new versions of Expo Go and consider testing those versions to see if the issue is resolved.
4. **Consider EAS Build:** Explore Expo's EAS Build to build a standalone APK, which is often more stable than using the Expo Go app directly.
